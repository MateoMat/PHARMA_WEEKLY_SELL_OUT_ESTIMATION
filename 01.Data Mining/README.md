* The number of all observations available for weekly data - 70
    * training set - 56 observations
    * test set - 14 observations
* Monthly accuracy will be compared on validation set consist:
    * validation external monthly set - 15 
    * based on model monthly prediction - 15
    
* The number of all observations available for monthly data data - 16
    
# Internal Data description & conclusions:

Data comes from customer transactional systems. Understanding database rules and changes to identifiers is an extremely important element.

The assumption that individual customer IDs are permanent should be rejected.
The only common feature describing a single point of sale is the address, however, there are duplicates too.

An important element in the selection of clients for the research panel is:
Â  
* obligatory value 1 in the 'Active' field of the source customer dimension table (dbo.stanSynchronizacji)
* examine the availability of data during the period considered.
  

* To maintain the usefulness of the model in the long term - an important element of customer selection is verified internal knowledge about maintaining reporting continuity. 
    * Based on this analysis, **82** were rejected from the database

* The data shows a delay in synchronizing some clients to the database. As recommended by the software owner, the data achieve high convergence within +3 business days from the end of the analyzed period.
    
    
* On the day the clients were defined, **1938** unique clients entered the research panel.
