# PHARMA_WEEKLY_SELL_OUT_ESTIMATION


## Overview
The volume of sales to the consumer should be the basis for strategic analyzes of sales-based organizations.
It is using in many areas such as sales,marketing, finance, production.


Demand results directly affect the next links in the distribution chain.


Short and long-term product strategies are based on achieving a specific result in monthly data.

It is a strong business need for weekly data monitoring.
This knowledge is useful for monitoring of the current performance level in the relation to the assumptions, predict monthly performance, and take action in case of deviations.

Such data provided by external companies is expensive, so this project aims to use internal data to estimate weekly data at national level.

## Goals

The goal is to estimate weekly data for each SKU (Stock Keeping Unit), so that the sum of weekly data reaches satisfactory accuracy for monthly data.

The goal is to build a model for predicting national weekly data for each SKU (Stock Keeping Unit), which the sum of weekly data will reach 97% accuracy compared to monthly data.

This project describes the methodology and procedure for one SKU whose actual name has been blinded.
